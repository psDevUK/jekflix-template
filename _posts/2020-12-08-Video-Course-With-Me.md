## Welcome

 Thanks for taking the time to visit this blog. I decided to try and up the momentum of this blog, and I have now recorded a video series on how to create custom components from start to finish.  I include all of the steps I personally take and the URLs where I find this information. I also provide a modified JSX file to bind the component better to UD. This video course will de-mystify the black art behind creating custom components

## What Does This Course Cover?

Everything needed to build your own custom component. 14 videos that guide you from start to finish plus the UD component template zip file and the end modified JSX file for the project and the modified .PS1 function file.
