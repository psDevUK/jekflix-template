## Welcome

 Wow this blog site is officially one year old. I wasn't expecting to be blogging again so soon, but I have recently published 4 new powershell modules to the powershell gallery, and this is the 4th module, but I figured this could to with a bit of explaining. This module is now on the Powershell gallery and [can be downloaded by following this link](https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/UniversalDashboard.AnimateSvg/1.0.0)

## Where Did You Find It?

As with most of the components I build I found this on **npmjs.com** the exact link to the [project can be found by clicking on this link](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-mt-svg-lines) I saw this component a long-time ago, but just never got round to building it.

## What Parameters Does It Have?

Well if you have a butchers at the original project on npmjs I have included each **prop** as a powershell parameter:-

```
 param(
        [Parameter()]
        [string]$Id = (New-Guid).ToString(),
        [Parameter()]
        [int]$Duration = 3000,
        [Parameter()]
        [string]$ViewBox = "0 0 20 20",
        [Parameter()]
        [string]$Stroke = "black",
        [Parameter()]
        [decimal]$StrokeWidth = 0.2,
        [Parameter()]
        [string]$Fill = "none",
        [Parameter()]
        [string]$d = "M17.431,2.156h-3.715c-0.228,0-0.413,0.186-0.413,0.413v6.973h-2.89V6.687c0-0.229-0.186-0.413-0.413-0.413H6.285c-0.228,0-0.413,0.184-0.413,0.413v6.388H2.569c-0.227,0-0.413,0.187-0.413,0.413v3.942c0,0.228,0.186,0.413,0.413,0.413h14.862c0.228,0,0.413-0.186,0.413-0.413V2.569C17.844,2.342,17.658,2.156,17.431,2.156 M5.872,17.019h-2.89v-3.117h2.89V17.019zM9.587,17.019h-2.89V7.1h2.89V17.019z M13.303,17.019h-2.89v-6.651h2.89V17.019z M17.019,17.019h-2.891V2.982h2.891V17.019z"

    )
```

As you can see I have provided default values for each parameter so if you just specify the name of the module then this will show a 5 second animated bar-chart icon. However I am assuming that most users will want to animate their own choice of SVG graphic. Well this blog will cover how to achieve this. So [this is the first link for some SVG icons](http://svgicons.sparkk.fr/) and [I even made a component for this icon library](https://simpleicons.org/) which has so many amazing icons, opening the SVG image in your browser then right clicking on the image and selecting **inspect element** this will then show you a ```<path>``` tag inside this tag there is a ```d=``` which shows the path vector paths of the SVG. This is what is needed to make the SVG animated on your screen. You also need to make a note of the **viewBox** to get the proper dimensions for the SVG you want to display. As these are SVG they will look just as clean in a size 12 column as a size 1 column, thats the beauty of SVGs. Finally I [found this website hosting SVG graphics](https://www.svgrepo.com) which I found a nice looking Batman SVG logo which I opened in my FireFox browser inspected the element and got the **d** tag for the vector paths of the SVG and the **viewBox** for the dimensions. [Here is another great site for SVG icons](https://icofont.com/icons)

## Example Using The Component

So after waffling on about this component, it is time to show it on a dashboard so here is a bunch of SVG icons that will nicely animate just the once, till they show the completed SVG.

## Which Gives You This

## Conclusion

 Once again this component is really for the end-user of your dashboards, to look at in amazement, and think wow our I.T person is one cool human being. I thought it looked fancy enough to make into it's own component, and will only serve to make your page look a bit more bling-tastic. I hope you enjoyed reading this blog and that this component finds its way to your dashboard you are building.
