# About

I started my I.T career way back in the year 2000. I started out on helpdesks, then worked my way to 2nd level support. After spending several years trouble-shooting various problems, and manually solving problems, I wanted to look into how I could automate tasks.  So nearly 10 years ago I looked at Powershell.  Since then I have not looked back, I have used my programming skills to solve many different I.T and non I.T issues, by being able to either automate the task, or provide a graphical end-solution for the user.
